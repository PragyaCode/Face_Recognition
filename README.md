AI-Enchanced Facial Recognition for Smart Attendance
â€”This research offers a solution to the attainment
problems by proposing an automated attendance management
system using cutting edge AI facial recognition technology. The
system which utilizes face_recognition and OpenCV libraries for
real-time identification of people in videos and records it with high
accuracy of recognition. The implementation entails loading and
encoding images from a previously created database of known
faces, identifying faces in a live stream, and comparing them with
the database to allow a successful attendance recording. The data
obtained from the experiments show how the system works
efficiently mode is processing and administering attendance. It
had an accuracy to detect different facial orientations and lighting
atmosphere too was robust in nature. The attendance information
including check in and check out time is recorded in the system
with the CSV file is created daily to store the data. This paper is
divided into observations which includes the technical
architecture, related challenges and enhancements for scalability
and privacy enhancements. One of the most remarkable features
of our system is its capacity to automate attendance processes. This
system is much more effective than manual methods in terms of
efficiency with no extra hassles regarding manual errors and
administrative overhead. This study does not only demonstrate
the practicality of facial recognition in learning environments, but
also promotes the discussion on ethical concerns and privacy
issues surrounding biometric systems.
